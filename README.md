### Features of Java

 - **Simple** 
 -- Syntax is easy.
 -- Automatic Garbage Collection
 -- No explicit Pointers. Which makes it even more secure
 - **Object Oriented**
 - **Platform Independent**
 -- Same byte code can be ran on any machine.
 - **Secure**
 -- No Explicit pointers
 -- Runs inside a Virtual Machine
- **Architechture Neutral**
-- Memory limit of variables in C depends on architechture, i.e. size of int in a **32-bit** system differs from that in a **64-bit** system. Where as in Java size of variables are consistent.
- **Portable**
-- We can carry the same java bytecode to any platform.
- **High Performance**
-- It is faster than other traditional interpreted languages, as java bytecode is closer to native code. It is still slower than C, C++
- **Multi Threaded**
- **Dynamic**
-- Classes are loaded on demand.
-- Also supports feature
