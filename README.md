### Features of Java

<details>
  <summary>Simple</summary>
 
 - Syntax is easy.
 - Automatic Garbage Collection
 - No explicit Pointers. Which makes it even more secure  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Object Oriented</summary>
  
  - Supports Concepts of OOP.
  </details>
 
<details>
  <summary>Platform Independent</summary>
  
 - Same byte code can be ran on any machine.
</details>
 
<details>
  <summary>Secure</summary>
  
 - No Explicit pointers
 - Runs inside a Virtual Machine
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Architechture Neutral</summary>
  
- Memory limit of variables in C depends on architechture, i.e. size of int in a **32-bit** system differs from that in a **64-bit** system. Where as in Java size of variables are consistent.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Portable</summary>
  
- We can carry the same java bytecode to any platform.
</details>


<details>
  <summary>High Performance</summary>
  
- It is faster than other traditional interpreted languages, as java bytecode is closer to native code. It is still slower than C, C++
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Multi Threaded</summary>
  
  - Self Explanatory
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Dynamic</summary>
  
- Classes are loaded on demand.
- Also supports feature from native languages like C, C++ (JNI Libraries)
- Supports dyanmic compilation and automatic memory management (garbage collection)
